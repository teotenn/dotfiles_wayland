* PERSONAL CONFIG FILES FOR WAYLAND

This are my personal dotfiles for wayland. The main setup I use is hyprland on debian testing.

* Install hyprland on debian

The installation works with Debian Trixie, although I have it with the more generic "testing" version.
I guess that after Trixie andwith Hyprland updates it will be a matter of trial and error until somebody wants to maintain an official Debian package.

The list of dependencies I got it from JaKooLit's [[https://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland/blob/main/install-scripts/00-dependencies.sh][script]] although it includes packages for its own dotfiles.
Recently the official [[https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/][installation guide]] included a list of dependencies for Ubuntu so, it can be cross-referenced for a cleaner installation process.
Is also this installation guide that I used to install after all the dependencies were present in my system.
